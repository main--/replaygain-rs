replaygain-rs
=============

Analyze audio data to get the ReplayGain tags (gain, peak).

This is little more than a wrapper around the replaygain analysis functionality provided by ffmpeg's af_replaygain. Unlike af_replaygain however, this gives you the actual values instead of just printing them to the console and then throwing them away. So close, yet so far.
